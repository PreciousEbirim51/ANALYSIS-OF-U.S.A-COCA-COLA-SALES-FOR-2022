INTRODUCTION

This analysis examines Coca-Cola’s sales performance in the United States during 2022, a year marked by economic recovery from pandemic impacts but also facing new challenges like inflation and supply chain disruptions.

PRE ANALYSIS

A pre-analysis phase was conducted to establish an analytical framework before the creation of the dashboard. This pre-analysis phase involves:

Project Split: The dataset was split into two variables which are independent and dependent variables and this helps in understanding the relationship between the data points and can provide hint on the type of insights that can be gotten from the dataset.

Potential Analysis/Questions: In this step, the questions that can be answered with the dataset were identified and it will serve as a bearing during the analysis.

Potential Insights: I was able to uncover some insights during this step just by observing the data split and it aided in my analysis by narrowing my focus on the important insights that can be gotten from the data set.

Storytelling: After the earlier steps described above, it became easier to tell a story from the dataset by relating the datapoints with each other.
